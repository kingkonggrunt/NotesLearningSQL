# Querying Multiple Table
- To bring together from two or more tables requires the use of a JOIN
- This chapter focuses on the most simplest form of JOIN, the INNER JOIN
## What is a Join?
- Queries against a single table are quite rare, most queries require two or more tables
- Imagine wanting to retrieve the customers name and address from the database, this will require a retrieving data from both the customer and address tables of the database.
	- The tables are connected via a foreign key relationship in the customer.address_id column, which references a row in the address table
	- The JOIN query will use the foreign key as the transportation between the customer and address table
	- This is a JOIN
### Cartesian Product
- If you join two tables without specify how the table should be joined, the database returns every premutation of the two tables - the Cartesian product
- This is also known as the Cartesian Product
```mysql
SELECT 
	c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM customer c JOIN address a;
/*Returns 361197 rows when customer only has 599 and address has 603*/
```
### Inner Joins
- To modify a join so that only a single row is returned for each customer, you need to describe the relationship between each table
- The customer and address tables are linked by an address_id column so you should specific that in the FROM clause
```mysql
SELECT
	c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM customer c JOIN address a
	ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
```
- If the value exists in the foreign key column in only one table but not in the other, the join fails for that row and is excluded from the result set
	- This is know as an INNER join
- By default the database server will perform an inner join for your join, but it is good practice to include the type of join you want to do when performing a join
- If the names of the columns used to perform the join are identical then you can use USING instead of ON as a shorthand notation
```mysql
SELECT
	c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM customer c JOIN address a
	USING (address_id);
```
## The ANSI Join Syntax
- The joins shown so far follow the syntax and notation as specifcied by the SQL92 version of the ANSI SQL standard. All major database servers follow this standard and syntax
- They also include an older join syntax that you can use, since the databases where developed before the introduction of the standard
```mysql
SELECT
	c.first_name, c.last_name, a.adress
FROM customer c, address a
WHERE c.address_id = a.address_id;
/*Old standard*/


SELECT
	c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM customerc INNER JOIN address a
	ON c.address_id = a.address_id
WHERE a.postcode = 52137;
/*ANSI standard*/

```
- The ANSI standard has several advantages
	- Conditions for joins and conditions for filtering are separated into different clauses (ON and WHERE) making it easier to read and understand the query
	- The JOIN condition is on it's own clause (ON) making it less likely for it to be omitted
	- Queries that follow the ANSI standard are portable across database servers
	- It's readily apparent what type of join is employed
	- It's clear if a join condition has been left out

## Join with Three or More Tables
- When joining three tables you need three tables, two join types and two on subclauses
- Let's change the previous query to return the customers city instead of address
	- Since city accessed via a foreign key to the city table you'll need to join the city table to include the name of the city in the result set
- To show the city name you need to traverse from the customer table to the address table to the city name via the address_id and city_id columns
```mysql
SELECT 
	c.first_name, c.last_name, ct.city
FROM customer c
	INNER JOIN address a
		ON c.address = a.address_id
	INNER JOIN city ct
		ON a.city_id = ct.city_id;
```
- At first glance you may think the order the tables appear in the JOIN clause is important. Switching the order of the tables returns the same results but ordering may be different
### Does Join Order Matter?
- SQL is a nonprocedural language, you only describe what you want to retrieve and the database decides how best to execute your query. Therefore the order in which you specific tables doesn't affect the results
- The table the server uses as a starting point for your join is called the driving table
- If you do need the tables to be joined in a particular order then you can specific that in your query
	- In MySQL you use straight_join
	- SQL server force order
	- Oracle Database: ordered or leading optimzier hint
```mysql
SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN c.first_name, c.last_name, ct.city
FROM city ct
	INNER JOIN address a
	ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
	INNER JOIN customer c
	ON c.address_id = a.address_id
```
### Using Subqueries as Tables
- A subquery is a form of a table that is accepted in the FROM clause
```mysql
SELECT
	c.first_name, c.last_name, addr.address, addr.city
FROM customer c
	INNER JOIN
		(SELECT
			a.address_id, a.address, ct.city
		FROM address a
			INNER JOIN city ct
				ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
		WHERE a.district = 'California'
		) addr
		ON c.address_id = addr.address_id;
```
- Although we can get the same result by join three tables and using filtering, using subqueries in joins can sometimes be advantageous from a performance or readability aspect
### Using the Same Table Twice
- Sometimes when joining multiple tables, you might find that you need to join the same table more than once
- Example
	- In the sample database lets find films in which either one of two actors appear in 
```mysql
SELECT 
	f.title
FROM film f
	INNER JOIN film_actor fa
		ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
	INNER JOIN actor a
		ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
WHERE ((a.first_name = 'CATE' AND a.last_name = 'MCQUEEN')
	  OR (a.first_name = 'CUBA' AND a.last_name = 'BIRCH'))
```
- This query finds movies which either Cate McQueen or Cuba Birch appear
- What if you want to find movies which both actors appear.
	- To find this you need to find rows in the film_actor table which contain a row for cate and a row for cuba. Therefore you need to include the film_actor and actor tables twice
```mysql
SELECT
	f.title
FROM film f
	INNER JOIN film_actor fa1
		ON f.film_id = fa1.film_id
	INNER JOIN actor a1
		ON fa1.actor_id = a1.actor_id
	INNER JOIN film_actor fa1
		ON f.film_id = fa2.film_id
	INNER actor a2
		ON fa2.actor_id = a2.actor_id
WHERE (a1.first_name = 'CATE' AND a1.last_name = 'MCQUEEN')
	AND (a2.first_name = 'CUBA' AND a2.last_name = 'BIRCH');
```

### Self Joins
- Not only can you include the same table more than once, but you can actually join a table to itself
- A valid reason to do this is for tables that include a self-referencing foreign key - a column that points to a primary key within the same table
- Imagine the film table as a column called prequel_film_id which points to the films parent
	- You can write a join that refers to itself to list the the name of the prequel film
```mysql
SELECT
	f.title, f_prnt.title prequel
FROM film f
	INNER JOIN film f_prnt
		ON f_prnt.film_id = f.prequel_film_id
WHERE f.prequel_fil_id IS NOT NULL;
```

## Test your Knowledge
- Fill in the blanks for the following query to obtain the reuslts that follow
```mysql
SELECT
	c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address, ct.city
FROM customer c
	INNER JOIN address <1>
		ON c.address_id = a.address_id
	INNER JOIN city ct
		ON a.city_id = <2>
WHERE a.district = 'California';
```
```
<1> = a
<2> = ct.city_id
```

- Write a query that returns the title for every film in which an actor with the first name JOHN appeared
```mysql

SELECT
	f.title
FROM film f 
	INNER JOIN film_actor fa
		ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
	INNER JOIN actor a
		ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
WHERE a.first_name = "JOHN";
```

- Construct a query that returns all addresses that are in the same city. You will need to join the address table to itself, and each row should include two different addresses
```mysql
SELECT
	a.address addr1, a2.address addr2, a1.city_id
FROM address a 
	INNER JOIN address a2
WHERE a2.city_id = a.city_id;
	AND a.address_id <> a2.address_id;	
```
