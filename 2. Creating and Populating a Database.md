# Creating and Populating a Database
## Creating a MySQL Database
- Sakila sample database is a fictious movie rental company
## Using the mysql Command-Line Tool
- `mysql -u root -p;`
- `show databases`
- `use sakila`  `use <database>`
- `mysql -u root -p sakila`
- Some database services require a `FROM` statement in your query, for function calls, database services provide a table called `dual` to complete it.
- `SELECT now()`
## MySQL Data Types
### Character Data
- Stored as either fixed-length or variable-length strings
	- Fixed-lenght: right-padded with spaces and always consume the same number of bytes
	- Variable-length: not right-padded and don't always consume the same number of bytes
- When defining a character column, you must specify the maximum size of any string to be stored in the column
	- `char(20) /* fixed-length */`
	- `varchar(20) /* variable-length */`
- Maximum length for char is 255 bytes
- Maximum length for varchar is 65,535 bytes
- If you need to store longer strings like emails, and XML documents, then you should use `mediumtext` and `longtext` instead
#### Character sets
- For latin languages like English, the amount of characters in the alphabet can be stored into a single byte
- Languages like Japanese and Korean, require multiple bytes of data to store all the characters of the language, these character sets are call *multibyte character sets*
- `SHOW CHARACTER SET;`
- Prior to version 8, the default character set was `latin1`, but version 8 defaults to `utf8mb4`
- You can define a character set for each character column in your database or for a table in the database, or for a database
	- `varchar(20) character set latin1`
	- `create database european_sales character set latin1;`
	
#### Text data
- For storing text above 64KB in size
- Types:
	- tinytext: 255
	- text: 65,535
	- mediumtext: 16,777,215
	- longtext: 4,294,967,295
- When using a text type, be aware of the following
	- Data will be truncated if it exceeds the maximum text size for the column
	- Trailing spaces are not removed
	- Only the first 1,024 bytes of a text column is used for sorting ang grouping, although this can change
	- Text types are unique to different mySQL servers
	- There isn't a need to tinytext after V4 - which removed the 255 limit for varchar
- If storing a dataeentry column, then `varchar` is adequate
- If storing a document, then `mediumtext` or `longtext` is better
### Numeric Data
- Numeric data can be used in different ways, and the different numeric data types reflect these different ways
	- A boolean column to mark something as True or False
	- A primary key with auto intcrement
	- A postive number to represent item number in a shopping basket
	- Precise positional data
- Numeric columns can be integers and even unsigned (>0) or signed integers (allow for - numbers)
- Integer types
	- tinyint, smallint, mediumint, int, bigint
- floating-point types
	- float, double
	- you are allowed to define the precision and scale of the floating point number
		- precision: the total allowable amount of digits
		- scale: allowable amount of digits to the right of the decimal point
		- storing numbers exceeding the scale or precision will round the number or throw an error
	- can be unsigned or signed
	
### Temporal Data
- Dates and time
- Examples
	- Future date of a particular event
	- Shipping date
	- Birth date
	- Year column
	- Elapsed time
- Types
	- Date: YYYY-MM-DD 
	- Datetime: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
	- Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
	- Year: YYYY
	- Time: HHH:MI:SS
- Time, Datetime, Timestamp allow for fractional seconds up to 6 decimal places. 
	- datetime(2): timevalues up to 2 decimal places (hundredths of a second)
- Implementations
	- employee birth date: date - since knowing the time someone is born is usually excessive
	- when an order has shipped: datetime
	- track when a row has been modified: timestamp -- mysql can automatically populate a timestamp column with the servers time
	- column for year: year
	- record length of time for an action, task, or routine: time

## Table Creation
- Let's define a table to hold information about a person
### Step 1: Design
- Brainstorm about what kind of information would be usefule for a person
	- Name
	- Eye color
	- Birthdate
	- Address
	- Favourite Foods
- Assign column names and data types
	- name: varchar(40)
	- eye_color: char(2)
	- birth_date: date
	- address: varchar(100)
	- favorite_foods: varchar(200)
### Step 2: Refinement
- The process of normalisation is ensuring there are no duplicate data and compound columns in your database design
- In looking at our example database table the problems arise
	- name: is a compound object consisting of first and last name
	- there is no column that guaranttees unqiueness
	- address: is a compount object of street, street number, city, state, country, postal code
	- favourite_foods: is a list containing 0, 1, or more independent items. It's better to create a separate table with foreign key relationships
- After considering these components
	- Person Table:
		- person_id: smallint (unsigned)
		- first_name: varchar(20)
		- last_name: varchar(20)
		- eye_color: char(2)
		- birth_date: date
		- street: varchar(30)
		- city: varchar(20)
		- state: varchar(20)
		- country: varchar(30)
		- postal_code: varchar(20)
	- Favourite_food:
		- person_id: foreign key from person table
		- food: varchar(20)
	- Something to consider:
		- You might decide to control want favourite_foods people are allowed to pick. In this case you can have a food table with food_id and food_name columnes and alter the food column in favourite_food to contain a foreign key to food. This woulld be a fully normalised design but its up to you what you want
### Step 3: Building SQL Schema Statements
- After designing and refining the table its time to construct the table with a schema statement
#### people Table
```mysql
CREATE TABLE person
(
	person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
	fname VARCHAR(20),
	lname VARCHAR(20),
	eye_color CHAR(2) CHECK (eye_color IN ('BR', 'BL', 'GR')
	birth_date DATE,
	street VARCHAR(30),
	city VARCHAR(20),
	state VARCHAR(20),
	country VARCHAR(20),
	postal_code VARCHAR(20),
	CONSTRAINT pk_person PRIMARY KEY (person_id)
);
```
- Two constraints in this table
	- A check constraint for the eye_color column
	- A primary key constraint for the person_id column
- A check constraint does not enforce the constraint, if you need it to be enforced then the *enum* data type is used - it mergers the check constraint with the data type of the column
	- `eye_color ENUM('BR', 'BL','GR')` 
- What is Null?
	- Sometimes it's not possible to provide a vlaue for a column in your table. In this case this column is *null* 
	- Null can be used when the value is not applicable, unknown, or an empty set
	- When designing a table, you must specify which columns you allow to be null or not null
#### favourite_food table
```mysql
CREATE TABLE favorite_food
(
	person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
	food VARCHAR(20),
	CONSTRAINT pk_favorite_food PRIMARY KEY (person_id, food),
	CONSTRAINT fk_fav_food_person FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person (person_id)
);
```
- Because a person can have multiple food, we cannot guarantee uniqueness with only the person_id column so we create a two column primary key
- A foreign key constraint is placed on the person_id column, the only values that can exist in this column are person_id values that exist in the person table
- Foreign key constraints can be added afterwards using the alter table statement

## Populating and Modifying Tables
- `insert, update, delete, select`
### Inserting Data
- Three componenets to an insert statement
	- Name of table to insert data into
	- Name of columns to populate
	- Values to populate the table
- You don't need to provide data for every column in the table, you can update it later for leave it null due to circumstances
#### Generating numeric key data
- How are nuemric primary keys generated?
	- Add one to the largest primary key value
	- Let the db provide the value for you
- The most robust way is to let the db do it for you
- In MySQL you can do this by turning the primary_key column's *auto-increment* feature
- This is usually done at table creation by you can do it afterwards using `alter table`
```mysql
ALTER TABLE person MODIFY person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT;
```
- When doing this you need to disable foreign key constraints and renable them afterwards
```mysql
set foreign_key_checks=0;
ALTER TABLE person
	MODIFY person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT;
set foreign_key_checks=1;
```
- Now when you insert data into the person_id table, you can add the null value to the person_id field and the database will automatically generate the primary key id
#### The insert statement
- Add data
```mysql
INSERT INTO person
	(person_id, fname, lname, eye_color, birth_date)
	VALUES (null, 'William', 'Turner', 'BR', '1972-05-27');
```
- You can insert a string into a date column as long as the string matches the format for the columns date type. It will convert the string for you
```mysql
INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
	VALUES (1, 'pizza');
INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
	VALUES (1, 'cookies');
INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
	VALUES (1, 'nachos');	
```
```mysql
INSERT INTO person
	(person_id, fname, lname, eye_color, birth_date, street, city, state, country, postal_code)
	VALUES (null, 'Susan', 'Smith', 'BL', '1975-11-02', '23 Maple St.', 'Arlington', 'VA', 'USA', '20220');
```
#### Can I Get That in XML?
- you can output a sql query using the `--xml` option when you login
#### Updating Data
```mysql
UPDATE person
	SET 
	street = '1225 Tremont St.',
	city = 'Boston',
	state = 'MA',
	country = 'USA',
	postal_code = '02138'
	WHERE person_id = 1;
```
#### Deleting Data
```mysql
DELETE FROM person
	WHERE person_id = 2;
```
### When Good Statements Go Bad
- Common mistakes when you are inserting and modifying data
#### Nonunique Primary Key
```mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO person
-> (person_id, fname, lname, eye_color, birth_date)
-> VALUES (1, 'Charles','Fulton', 'GR', '1968-01-15');
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'
```
- Due to the primary key constraint on person_id, you cannot provide a duplicate key value to the table if the key value already exists in the table
#### Nonexistent foreign key
- Here's what happens if you add a value into a foreign key constraint column that doesn't exist in the foreign key table
```mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
-> VALUES (999, 'lasagna');
ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint
fails ('sakila'.'favorite_food', CONSTRAINT 'fk_fav_food_person_id' FOREIGN KEY
('person_id') REFERENCES 'person' ('person_id'))
```
#### Foreign key constrains are enforced if you tables are created using the InnoDB storage engine [[Learning SQL#Transactions|Transactions]]
##### Column Value Violations
- If you set a value outside of the enum for eye color
```mysql
mysql> UPDATE person
-> SET eye_color = 'ZZ'
-> WHERE person_id = 1;
ERROR 1265 (01000): Data truncated for column 'eye_color' at row 1
```
- not happy with it
#### Invalid Data Conversions
- If you provide a string to a date column that doesn't match the expected format, you receive an error
```mysql
mysql> UPDATE person
-> SET birth_date = 'DEC-21-1980'
-> WHERE person_id = 1;
ERROR 1292 (22007): Incorrect date value: 'DEC-21-1980' for column 'birth_date'
at row 1
```
- It's usally a good idea to explicitly state the format string for your string instead of relying on the database - use the `str_to_date` function
```mysql
UPDATE person
	SET birth_date = str_to_date('DEC-21-1980', '%b-%d-%Y')
	WHERE person_id = 1;
```
