# Working with Sets
- Relational databases are all about sets
- How to combine multiple result sets using various set operators - union, intersect, except
## Set Theory Primer
- A union B: the combination of sets A and B
- A intersect B: The subset of data that is common in both A and B. If there is no overlap between the two sets the intersection result set will be empty
- A except B: The subset of A that has nothing in common with set B
- Using union, intersect and except you can create any result set
- What if we wanted all of A and all of B without the overlapping of A and B?
	- You'll need the union of A and B
	- And another operation to removing the overlapping region
	- The overlapping region is A intersect B so the operation to remove this region from the total set will be 
		- `(A union B) except (A intersect B)`
		- You could also acheive this result with `(A except B) union (B except A)`
## Set Theory in Practice
- Before we combine data sets we need to understand the composition of the dataset
- When tables are combined together into a set, the 1 column of the first table combines with the 1st column of the 2nd table, and the 2nd column of the first table .... etc
- When performing set operations you should
	- Ensure that both data sets have the same number of columns
	- The data types of each column across the data sets are the same (or that they can be converted into one)
- Overlapping data would be rows in each column pair that are identical
- You can perform a set operation by placing a set operator between two select statements
```mysql
SELECT 1 num, 'abc' str
UNION
SELECT 9 num, 'xyz' str;
```
- This kind of query is known as a compound query because it combines multiple, otherwise-independent queries
	- Compound queries may include more than two queries if multipl eset operations are needed to attain the final results
## Set Operators
- SQL allows you to perform various set operations, and for each operator there are two flavors provided, one that includes duplicates (all) and one that removes duplicates (-all)
### The union Operator
- `union` and `union all`
- union sorts the comined sets and removes duplicates
- union all does not
	- The number of rows in the results set of a union all will equal to the number of rows of the sets being combined
	- This is the most simplised set opeartion of the database server to perform since the server no longer needs to check for overlapping data
- The following example generates a set of first and last names from multiple tables
```mysql
SELECT
	'CUST' typ, c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
UNION ALL
SELECT
	'ACTR' typ, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a;
```
- If you want your combined table to exclude duplicate rows then you need to use the union operator instead
```mysql
SELECT 
	c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
UNION
SELECT 
	a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%';
/*This will remove duplicate first and last name people that exist on both the actor table and the customer table*/
```
### The intersect Operator
- While the ANSI SQL specification includes the intersect operator, version 8.0 of MySQL does not implement the intersect operator
	- Orcale and SQL Server 2008 do have intersect
- Intersect will show rows that exist on both data sets
### The except Operator
- Like except, the ANSI SQL specification includes the except operator, but MySQL does not have an except Operator
	- In Oracle Database, you will have to use the minus operator instead
- Except will return the first result set minus any part of the set that overlaps with the second results set
- Except will remove all duplicates of overlapping data but except all will only remove the overlapping data and not the duplicates
## Set Operation Rules
- There are rules that you must follow when wokring with compoun queries
### Sorting Compound Query Results
- You can sort the results set using an order by clause, but you will need to choose a column name from the first query of the compound query
```mysql
SELECT
	a.first_name fname, a.last_name lname
FROM actor a
UNION ALL
SELECT
	c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
ORDER BY lname, fname

/*ORDER BY first_name and last_name will fail*/
```
### Set Operation Precedence
- If your compund query contains more than two queries using different set operations, then you'll need to think about the order in which you place the queries in your compound statement
```mysql
SELECT
	a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
UNION ALL
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'M%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'T%'
UNION
SELECT SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' and c.last_name LIKE 'D%';
```
- Swapping the UNION ALL and UNION clauses in the above statement will alter the final results
- Take care when compounding multiple queries, typically queries are evaulated from top to bottom unless
	- There is an intersect operator - ANSI SQL calls for the intersect operator to have precedence over other set operators
	- You can dicate order by using parentheses
		- MySQL doesn't allow the use of parentheses in compound queries

## Test Your Knowledge
- If `set A = {L M N O P}` and `set B = {P Q R S T}`, what sets are generated by
	- A union B? `{L M N O P Q R S T}`
	- A union all B? `{L M N O P P Q R S T}`
	- A intersect B? `{P}`
	- A except B? `{L M N O}`

- Write a compound query that finds all the first and last names of all actors and customers whose last name starts with L.
```mysql
SELECT
	a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM actor a
WHERE a.last_name LIKE 'L%'
UNION
SELECT 
	c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.last_name LIKE 'L%';
```
- Sort the results from Exercise 6.2 by the last_name column
```mysql
SELECT
	a.first_name fname, a.last_name lname
FROM actor a
WHERE a.last_name LIKE 'L%'
UNION
SELECT 
	c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.last_name LIKE 'L%'
ORDER BY lname;
```
